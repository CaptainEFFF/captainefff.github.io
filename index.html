            <p>I've been using computers since I was three years old, I more or less taught myself at that age to use command line to play many of the old dos based adventure games. I guess it just ran in the family as my father, three of my uncles, and my grandfather were all involved in computer technology.</p>
        
            <p>When it came to my freshmen year is highschool I jumped on the opportunity to take computer science. I started with Visual Basic, simple programing in Excell, and sone minor frame animation work. I continued taking computer science every year during high school. I learned HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript, as well as Java and a bit of C++.</p>

            <p>Along side my computer science studies I took a video editing course, graphic desing, electronic imaging, and joined my schools photography and robotics clubs. The lader is where I learned most of my C++ and RobotC coding.</p>

            <p>After high school I took a bit of a hiatus from progimg to persue game design and video/audio editing. I took up streaming on Twitch and tried to turn a profit making gaming videos on YouTube. Long story short that plan didn't really work out and now I have found myself working a grocery store barely making more than minimum wage.</p>

            <p>During a trip to visit my brother in California I was introduced to the fullstack bootcamp he works for. I was instantly enthralled by the idea and started looking for similar progams back home on the east coast. Enter UNH and their bootcamp progam, before I knew is I was signed up and registered for the course.</p>

            <p>My goal is to make the most of this bootcamp program, enhance the skills I have learned in the past and master some new ones to find a new and succesfull career in web development.</p>
